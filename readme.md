## Database Backup Functionality

I used third party laravel package [paulvl/backup](https://github.com/paulvl/backup).

If you want to check the controller where I written main logic to take mysql-dump then please check here [https://github.com/abhisupekar/laravel/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/DBBackupController.php](https://github.com/abhisupekar/laravel/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/DBBackupController.php).

So, It will take dump of the database which we used for our laravel application i.e. for current application.
